Examples of using the Redbone library

# TCP
An example of a TCP transport can be found in `tcp / classes / Transport`.
It can be used for messaging with their processing in Redbone over TCP.

You can also find an example Ð¡lient class for TCP in the `classes` directory,
and connection classes, which serve more for testing purposes than for direct calls.
